# FrameWork
## Here is a brief introduction for interested readers.
## Data
  - For this project, we use the Semantic Drone Dataset from the Institute of Computer Graphics and Vision;
  - it consists of 400 images from nadir (birdâ€™s eye) view acquired at an altitude of 5 to 30 meters above the ground;
  - To carry on semantic segmentation tasks, we use pixel-accurate annotation of 24 classes (1 unlabeled class) to train and test models.

## Model
  - it will contain all the models we need;
  - we use simpleUnet.py and unet_advanced.py, which are two advanced version of venilla Unet;
  - we use enet.py, which is the pyfile for ENet, more accurate than Unet.

## Prune
  - Here are all the pruning techniques we tested, the comparison can be found in the [paper](Efficiency in Semantic Segmentation.pdf)
